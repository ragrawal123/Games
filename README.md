# percolation
This code contains sample driver code for the third ATCS project this year. Feel free to use it as you see fit.

You can run the benchmark by running 

    python3 benchmark.py

This benchmark will run the random player against the random player - you should see a win rate of 50%.

If you'd like to test your own code, you can modify the code in "percolator.py" and uncomment the appropriate lines in the benchmark.py file.
